The data being used here are from categorized News articles. For this experiment, to reduce the complexity, I have limited myself to use only the articles Title to predict the categories; namely - health, business, entertainment, science/tech. The same experiment has been conducted using both statistical and neural net methods. Multiclass classification techniques gets widely used in BFSI, manufacturing, supply-chain, pharma and HR domains. These are the areas in which I have used them and hence sharing. What I have learnt out of several implementations, using both text and numerical data, is that fair bit of time and effort should go in keenly reviewing/eyeing the input data and two, one should always experiement with at least three different implementations before zeroing in on an approach.
