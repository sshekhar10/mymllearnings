As a first step towards building a B2B recommendation engine, 
I wanted to become intimately familiar with the data and also try various statistical model
to get a fair understanding of how to detect and remove seasonality, detect trends, make predictions
to get some of the 'least' best numbers.

In this case, I am fetching data from NSE for few stocks and have used it as my time series data for further analysis.
You may want to check this blogpost to review my analysis. To reproduce the results all you need to do is to:
python tms_analysis_stocks.py
